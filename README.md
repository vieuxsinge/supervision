# Supervision

This repository contains the sources for a software able to do supervision of
the temperatures in our fermenters, at the [Brasserie du Vieux Singe (FR,
Rennes)](https://www.vieuxsinge.com).

We decided to implement a solution like this to be able to be notified when
problem occur with our cold group.

When problems are detected, a notification is sent to a [Signal](https://signal.org) group.

The script uses Python, and we make it run in a cronjob.

Data is collected locally via [connected
thermostats](https://github.com/vieuxsinge/stc1000esp) made out of STC1000.
They send messages via [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/) via Wifi to our server.

Messages are then aggregated by
[Telegraf](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/) in an
[InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/), and visualized via
[Grafana](https://grafana.com/).

(The script messages are implemented in French for now, as we are the only one using the tool)

## Installation

### DÃ©pendences

The system relies on [signal-cli](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli/) to send
notifications to a Signal group. 

You then have to install it. Here are some simple instructions to do so on Debian 10.

On Debian, you can follow [the instructions on this
page](https://packaging.gitlab.io/signal-cli/installation/standalone/). You
need to install `signal-cli-service` and `signal-cli-native`.

Once this is done, you need to configure signal-cli to connect with a Signal
account.

You can configure it with a phone number as a primary device or link an
existing device. We're linking here with a secondary device.

```bash
signal-cli-native link -n "Supervision brasserie" | tee >(xargs -L 1 qrencode -t utf8)
```

Then scan this QRcode on your signal app on Android.

You then need to sync the messages :

```bash
signal-cli-native -u +phone-number receive
```

And then you need to get the group ID you want to use.

```bash
signal-cli-native listGroups
```


```bash
git clone https://github.com/vieuxsinge/supervision.git && cd supervision
python -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

We've put a bunch of configuration files in the "config" folder.

- [The crontab file](config/crontab) for the script to run on its own ;
- [Grafana config files in JSON](config/grafana.json) to visualize data ;
- [Mosquito configuration](config/mosquito.conf) to receive data ;
- [Telegraf configuration](config/telegraf.conf) to aggregate the data.
